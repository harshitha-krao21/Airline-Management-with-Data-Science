# Predictive Analysis Task: Building and Saving Your Best Model

Build a predictive model that can accurately determine passenger satisfaction based on the dataset features. This model should be capable of predicting the satisfaction level of future passengers based on their respective data points.

Model Development: Using the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset (train.csv), developed a machine learning model that predicts passenger satisfaction.

"test.csv" contains the input data of test dataset without label. The column 'satisfaction' is empty initially. Using the model to predict the label of records in test set, the updated test.csv is saved with labels.
